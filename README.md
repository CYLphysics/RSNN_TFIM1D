# RSNN_TFIM1D

This is the sample code to demostrate the RSNN method for Transverse Field Ising Model (TFIM) in paper "Random Sampling Neural Network for Quantum Many-Body Problems, 
Chen-Yu Liu and Daw-Wei Wang"(https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.05199).
The functions are written in TFIM1D.py and the usage is shown in example_TFIM.ipynb. For more information, please read example_TFIM.ipynb
